Creates a report of user listening habits during the selected year
as a PDF and outputs some playlists recommendations.
	- Computes statistics from the library by:
		* Listening behavior (character)
		* Genres/styles
			+ Total
			+ Top 5
			+ Suggested genres
		* Musical categories (chart)
		* Tracks
			+ Total
			+ Most played track
			+ Top 5
		* Listens
			+ Total (minutes/days)
			+ Day with most listens
		* Artists
			+ Total
			+ Top 5
			+ Months reels
			+ Most played artist (and track)
		* Regions
			+ Top 5
			+ Artist/Country with more listens
		* Sound town
			+ Top 3 artists from that city
		* Mood stats (chart)
		* BPM stats (chart)
		* Key stats (chart)

	- Downloads artist and city images.
	  (Offline mode may be set to skip image downloading)

	- Retrieves album covers.

	- Generates random backgrounds (which can be customized by user).

	- Outputs a report in Latex format. Compilation in PDF.

Requirements:
-------------
	- Playback Statistics:
	https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_playcount

	- Enhanced Playback Statistics:
	https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_enhanced_playcount

	- LaTeX: Recommended LuaLaTeX via MiKTeX. Any version works.
		* Win 10+: any version
		https://miktex.org
		* Win 7 / Wine (64 bit): 22.7 version
		https://www.npackd.org/p/org.miktex.MiKTeX64/22.7
		* Win 7 / Wine (32 bit): 21.6 version
		https://www.npackd.org/p/org.miktex.MiKTeX/21.6

Optional:
---------
	- World-Map-SMP: To get country stats. Tags must be written
	to the JSON database. If locale tags are already present
	on tracks, use 'Database...\Merge file tags with JSON...'; 
	otherwise you will need to retrieve tags using the Bio panel.
	Note artists without a country on the JSON database will
	not be used on the country/city stats, so be sure to get
	the tags for all artists in your library (use 'Database...\
	Find artists without locale tags...').
	https://github.com/regorxxx/World-Map-SMP

	- Biography (Wil-B):
	https://github.com/Wil-B/Biography

	- ListenBrainz token: It's not a requisite to get
	playlists suggestions, since it will use the public API,
	but it will be less probably to reach rate limits with it.
	https://listenbrainz.org/settings/import/

	- TeXstudio: To compile manually (if desired), can also be
	configured to use LuaLaTeX engine, giving identical results
	to the automated CMD build.
	https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio
		* Win 10+: any version
		* Win 7: 4.3.0 (or lower)

	- ExifTool: To clean all metadata from images used on report.
	Binaries must be put at: .\helpers_external\exiftool\exiftool.exe
		* 64 bit: https://exiftool.org/
		* 32 bit: https://oliverbetz.de/pages/Artikel/ExifTool-for-Windows

	- Pingo: To optimize images used on report (will greatly reduce file size).
	Binaries must be put at: .\helpers_external\pingo\pingo.exe
		* 64 bit: https://css-ig.net/pingo
		* 32 bit: not available

LaTeX compilation:
------------------
The default installation uses LuaLaTeX via CMD:
lualatex --enable-installer --interaction=nonstopmode --jobname=Wrapped_%4 --output-directory=%3 %1

This command may be changed at the settings menu, in case other
other engine or format is preferred (any layout problems is your
responsibility though).

The CMD expression allows these numbered arguments which
are replaced at execution:
	- %1: input .tex file path
	- %2: output .pdf file path
	- %3: output directory path
	- %4: year

Ex:
lualatex --enable-installer --interaction=nonstopmode --jobname=Wrapped_2023 --output-directory="B:\foobar2000\profile\js_data\temp\wrapped" "B:\foobar2000\profile\js_data\temp\wrapped\Wrapped_2023.tex"
