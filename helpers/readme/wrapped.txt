Creates a report of user listening habits during the selected year
or the entire listening history as a PDF and outputs some playlists
recommendations using these stats.
	- Downloads listens from external services (if enabled):
		* ListenBrainz: match by MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID.

	- Retrieves listens from components:
		* Playback Statistics
		* Enhanced Playback Statistics
		* Playcount 2003

	- Deduplicates all listens retrieved (local or online).

	- Computes statistics from the library by:
		* Listening behavior (character)
		* Genres/styles
			+ Total
			+ Top 5
			+ Suggested genres
		* Musical categories (chart)
		* Tracks
			+ Total
			+ Most played track
			+ Top 5
		* Listens
			+ Total (minutes/days)
			+ Day with most listens
		* Artists
			+ Total
			+ Top 5
			+ Months reels
			+ Most played artist (and track)
		* Regions
			+ Top 5
			+ Artist/Country with more listens
		* Sound town
			+ Top 3 artists from that city
		* Mood stats (chart)
		* BPM stats (chart)
		* Key stats (chart)

	- Downloads artist and city images.
	  (Tries to use first image stub from WilB's Biography)
	  (Offline mode may be set to skip image downloading)

	- Retrieves album covers from tracks.

	- Generates random backgrounds (which can be customized by user).

	- Outputs a report in Latex format. Compilation in PDF.

	- Playlists recommendations:
		* Top Favorite Songs
		* Discovered Songs (during the year)
		* Top Artists
		* Top Genres
		* Top Countries
		* Suggested Genres (you may like) (ListenBrainz)
		  (Offline mode may be set to only use queries)
		* Suggested Artists (you make like) (ListenBrainz)
		  (Offline mode may be set to only use queries)

	- Year and Entire listening history reports may differ since
	the latter does not use time-related stats (from Enhanced
	Playback Statistics plugin).

Additional Tips:
----------------
	- You can use your own images in offline mode by putting them
	at '[foobar profile]\js_data\temp\wrapped\img\' subfolders. All
	(artist, album & cities) image file names must be lower case,
	without spaces, limited to 10 chars and jpg. Ex: 'fleetwoodm.jpg'

	- The stub image path is used wether offline mode is enabled or
	not, and these images are always preferred to downloaded ones.
	These images are automatically retrieved by TF expression (only
	applicable for artist images) and they are selected randomly
	from all images available at the matched folder.

	- In offline mode the artists images subfolder is not cleaned
	on every run (so any images present are kept indefinitely),

	- Listens are downloaded once before run (not on offline mode)
	and cached for 10 days. They are also re-downloaded if it detects
	some listens are missing. Note it will take some time since it
	will retrieve the entire listening history from external services.
	This database (to be reused offline) will be saved at:
	'[foobar profile]\js_data\listenbrainz_listens_[user].json'

	- In offline mode external listens may also be used as long as
	the user name associated have been provided (since the listening
	history is saved on JSON by username). Database as a single file
	containing an array of listen objects must be present at:
	'[foobar profile]\js_data\listenbrainz_listens_[user].json'

	- There is a setting to halve reported BPMs by tracks with a high
	value (> 130) because automatic BPM analysis tools usually fail
	reporting double the real BPM. Since the report doesn't care about
	specific track values, only the total BPM count on library, this
	can be used to rectify the histogram a bit by a specific proportion
	(which should be similar to the error rate of the analysis tool).
	By default is set to 30% (i.e. 30% random tracks with high BMP will
	be halved), which is a conservative estimation for tools like
	Essentia or foo_bpm. You can find the right proportion by yourself
	in your	library by selecting X random tracks -and different genres-
	with high BPM and checking how many of them have doubled values
	(the proportion should be uniform across the entire library).

Requirements:
-------------
	- Playback Statistics: For any report.
	https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_playcount

	- Enhanced Playback Statistics: For year reports.
	https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_enhanced_playcount
							OR
	- Playcount 2003: For year reports.
	https://marc2k3.github.io/component/playcount-2003/

	Note stats will be available only for dates posterior to the
	date the components were installed.

	- LaTeX: Recommended LuaLaTeX via MiKTeX. Any version works.
		* Win 10+: any version
		https://miktex.org
		* Win 7 / Wine (64 bit): 22.7 version
		https://www.npackd.org/p/org.miktex.MiKTeX64/22.7
		* Win 7 / Wine (32 bit): 21.6 version
		https://www.npackd.org/p/org.miktex.MiKTeX/21.6

Optional:
---------
	- Skip Count: To get some extra track stats.
	https://github.com/Fjara-h/foo_skipcount

	- World-Map-SMP: To get country stats. Tags must be written
	to the JSON database. If locale tags are already present
	on tracks, use 'Database...\Merge file tags with JSON...';
	otherwise you will need to retrieve tags using the Bio panel.
	Note artists without a country on the JSON database will
	not be used on the country/city stats, so be sure to get
	the tags for all artists in your library (use 'Database...\
	Find artists without locale tags...').
	https://github.com/regorxxx/World-Map-SMP

	- Biography (Wil-B): To be used along World-Map-SMP.
	https://github.com/Wil-B/Biography

	- ListenBrainz token: It's not a requisite to get
	playlists suggestions, since it will use the public API,
	but it will be less probably to reach rate limits with it.
	Additionally, the script may retrieve all listening history
	from the server and try to match listens with tracks from
	library (only by MBID), these will be deduplicated and used
	in addition to local playcount stats. To get a token visit:
	https://listenbrainz.org/settings/import/

	- TeXstudio: To compile manually (if desired); can also be
	configured to use LuaLaTeX engine, giving identical results
	to the automated CMD build.
	https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio
		* Win 10+: any version
		* Win 7: 4.3.0 (or lower)

	- ExifTool: To clean all metadata from images used on report.
	Binaries must be put at: .\helpers_external\exiftool\exiftool.exe
		* 64 bit: https://exiftool.org/
		* 32 bit: https://oliverbetz.de/pages/Artikel/ExifTool-for-Windows

	- Pingo: To optimize images used (will greatly reduce file size).
	Binaries must be put at: .\helpers_external\pingo\pingo.exe
		* 64 bit: https://css-ig.net/pingo
		* 32 bit: not available

LaTeX compilation:
------------------
The default installation uses LuaLaTeX via CMD:
lualatex --enable-installer --interaction=nonstopmode --jobname=Wrapped_%4 --output-directory=%3 %1

This command may be changed at the settings menu, in case other engine
or format is preferred (any layout problems is your responsibility though).

The CMD expression allows these numbered arguments which are replaced at
execution:
	- %1: input .tex file path (with quotes)
	- %2: output .pdf file path (with quotes)
	- %3: output directory path (with quotes)
	- %4: year

Ex:
lualatex --enable-installer --interaction=nonstopmode --jobname=Wrapped_2023 --output-directory="B:\foobar2000\profile\js_data\temp\wrapped" "B:\foobar2000\profile\js_data\temp\wrapped\Wrapped_2023.tex"
